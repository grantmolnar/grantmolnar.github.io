						My claims are more than mere frivolities:<br>
						From LCMs, they readily arise.<br><br>

						I study some summations on the side:<br>

						The sky forebodes, o’ercast with somber pall;<br>
						A weight that smothers in its heavy hours.<br>
						But lo! A clarion flame will burn it all!<br>
						The sun will rise with all his potent powers.<br><br>

						The earth beneath is patient in her shroud,<br>
						As still as death, though life may scurry on.<br>
						She’ll rise again, resplendent, regal, proud,<br>
						To kiss the sun beneath the breaking dawn.<br><br>

						And we alike may lift our weary eyes<br>
						Though weighty fortunes rest upon our wings<br>
						To gaze upon the luminescent skies<br>
						And greet the East and all the hope he brings.<br><br>

						The night is black, but passes sure and swift&mdash;<br>
						And day is ours, a sudden sacred gift<br>

						Alas for days like scattered golden leaves:<br>
						Abandoned litter on the fallow ground.<br>
						Another moment tumbles, turns, and weaves,<br>
						Then flutters to the earth without a sound.<br><br>

						I rake the days or leaves into a heap.<br>
						The vivid mess accrues before my eyes<br>
						As half-forgotten dreams are buried deep<br>
						And scarlet thoughts assume a drabber guise.<br><br>

						The Tree of Life is rife with verdure now:<br>
						She wanes anon as Autumn hastens on.<br>
						And though I try, I cannot fathom how<br>
						To keep her green, pristine like Summer's dawn.<br><br>

						Lo! Winter looms, and soon I too shall go<br>
						To join my leaves or days beneath the snow.<br>

							Passion</b><br><!--Written in 2015 in Jerusalem, save for the last stanza composed 2024/03/31-->
						The grotto where he bled was stark and bare,<br>
						Divorced from heaven, hemmed by slabs of stone.<br>
						He clutched the oil-slicked basin, wracked by prayer<br>
						Too raw and poignant to endure alone.<br><br>

						The cross from which he hung was stark and bare,<br>
						Beneath a heaven dark with holy rage.<br>
						And Earth herself lamented in despair<br>
						As Yahweh’s passing crowned the former age.<br><br>

						The now-forsaken tomb is stark and bare,<br>
						And Jesus Christ ascends with glory rife.<br>
						The Spirit bearing witness, I declare<br>
						That through the Son we have Eternal Life.<br><br>

						The chambers of my heart are stark and bare&mdash;<br>
						A knock? A voice! My Lord shall enter there.<br>
